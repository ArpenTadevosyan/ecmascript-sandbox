This repository is a place for you to learn Javascript (ECMASript2015 and above), and challenge your mentoring skills.
By adhering to a culture of being helful to others, you will learn the foudations of the language at a much quicker pace than you would on your own.

## How it works

1. Pick-up a technical aspect of the ECMAScript language you'd like to gain practice with.
* Working on a branch, create a code sample demonstrating how the language deals with this specific topic. Put the file for that sample in a directory named after the topic covered (e.g. `var-let-const`).
* Now, turn your code sample into a problem. To do so, include a comment at the top of your file presenting the problem. Make your code incomplete by removing key lines. Leave enough of the original code to help the user figure out how they should fix the problem. 
* Squash all your commits into one, rebase against the latest state of master, and make a pull request.
